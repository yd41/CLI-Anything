# cli-anything-slay-the-spire-ii

A stateful command-line interface for controlling the real Slay the Spire 2
game through the local `STS2_Bridge` mod. The CLI reads normalized game state
and sends action commands via a local HTTP API at `localhost:15526`.

## Installation

This CLI requires a bridge mod that runs inside the game process. Both the CLI
and the bridge are distributed from the same repository:

```
https://github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything
```

### 1. Install the CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything.git
cd CLI-Anything/slay_the_spire_ii/agent-harness
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Build and install the bridge mod

The bridge mod is a `.NET 9` plugin that must be compiled and installed into
the game directory. Full instructions are in the repository README, but the
short version is:

```bash
cd CLI-Anything/slay_the_spire_ii/agent-harness/bridge/plugin
./build.sh
cd ../install
./install_bridge.sh
```

If the build script cannot auto-detect the game data directory, set
`STS2_GAME_DATA_DIR` explicitly:

```bash
STS2_GAME_DATA_DIR="/path/to/data_sts2" ./build.sh
```

### 3. Enable the mod and verify

Launch Slay the Spire 2 via Steam, enable the `STS2_Bridge` mod in the mod
manager, then verify the connection:

```bash
cli-anything-sts2 state
```

If this returns JSON, the CLI and bridge are connected.

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.10+
- Slay the Spire 2 (Steam) with `STS2_Bridge` mod enabled
- `.NET 9 SDK` (only needed to build the bridge mod)

## For AI Agents

1. **Always read `state` first** to get the `decision` field
2. **Re-read state after each action** - indices and energy change during combat
3. **Check return codes** - 0 for success, non-zero for errors
4. **Parse stdout** for JSON output
